bossy
=====

Bossy is an open-source drone command and control system. It has a programmatic interface for automated flight of a drone. It also has a realtime interface that will show you flight statistics about in-progress flights using standard aviation instrumentation. Finally, it has a simple to implement protocol that will allow anyone with some decent programming experience to build a client that will allow you to utilize bossy to control any drone imaginable.
